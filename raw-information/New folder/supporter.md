# Volunteer

We roundly welcome all volunteers. There are certainly many ways in which you can have fun helping us to produce Walter Scott dramas.

This volunteering will have the added advantage of giving you experience in your chosen field and industry, and gaining you a reference from ourselves with regard to your kind help with our film and podcast making.

Here are some of the immediate ways in which you can help. Doubtless, as we grow, many more roles will develop.:

* Writing
    * You could help by writing some of Scott's short story screen adaptations (help will be given). When we have acquired (the copyright remains yours) four or more 'possible' scripts, these could be aggregated together to make a drmatic podcast season (see out other, (Thomas Hardy project)[http://localhost:8080/podcasts]) which would then be enacted and podcasted.
* Actors, Crew and Helpers
  * You could be in our cats, crew, or production teams. All levels, from beginner up, are most welcome.

# Friends

Our Friends are, perhaps, our most important individual supporters. Friends are not necessarily supporters, but have chosen to help the Scott Dramas Project in some other way

Friends can show their support for the work of the PBLF in almost any way. For example:

* Make a significant donation,
* Allow us to film a feature at your large period house.
* As a person, or organisation of considerable community standing, you could publicly endorse our aims.
We will honour our Friends by inscribing their name on our Friends' Roll of Honour. This is, of course, unless anonymity is required.

Friends automatically receive the benefits of 'A List' supporter.
