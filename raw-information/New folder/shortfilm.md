# Short Film

We will be making this 'concept short film' as a 'no budget' short film, working with other volunteers, if we can pre-sell enough DVDs / downloads to cover Ann-Marie and Rose's expenses to come up from Dorset for a fortnight of pre-production and a week of production (five days, and travelling two days). Any monies left over from making Wandering Willies' Tale will go towards the costs of developing our first feature, Scott's Rob Roy, in 2025.

Poster for Rob Roy - full face - not walking up hill

The first trilogy the Scottish Dramas Project (SDP) are adapting and producing consists of Rob Roy (2025), Guy Mannering (2026), and Waverly (2027). For the first feature, Rob Roy, the SDP hopes to gain the assitance of the Sir Walter Scott and the Clan Societies' memberships to help on pre-selling DVDs or a streaming version and 'in-kind' sponsorships. "Low Budget" features could thus be made cheaply with theatre and TV actors and a pro line / production manager and we part-times, amateurs and mad fans.

If Scottish A lister could possibly be attracted, film sales agents would then join in and cover these top actors at "Scale" pay, by pre-selling to foreign distributors. Rose and Ann-Marie would also approach domestic distributors.

Everyone, including Ann-Marie and Rose (except 'A list' actors and the line producer / PM who are highly paid professionals) would be paid the minimum wage at this level of financing. Ann-Marie would establish a Social Enterprise for the Inland Revenue, etc. Half of any profits made would be donated to the charities who helped the project and some of the rest of any profits would go to the leads and editor, etc. QAnn-Marie and Rose would perhaps use some of the reimagining profits to help cover their expenses in visiting Scotland for organising the following year's feature film.
