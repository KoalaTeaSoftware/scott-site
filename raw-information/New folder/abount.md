The Scottland Dramas Project is a grassroots community group lead by Rose Goldthorp, a young filmmaker who will adapt and produce ten of Scott's novels in ten years.

Rose has already started her Wessex Dramas project (2022) which has made one Thomas Hardy feature film and three seasons of audio dramas (https://thedailydilettante.com/). Rose hopes to work with different Scottish charities and their members, as she does in Dorset. So, these films will be 95% Scottish, in terms of source material, locations, casts, and crews.

The Scottland Dramas Project will be working with Scott and 'Scottland' enthusiasts from all over the globe. It will be concentrating, however, on a core of Edinburgh and S.E. Borders supporters, because of the cost of travel.
