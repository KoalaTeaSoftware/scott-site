# Short Film

We will be making this 'concept short film' as a 'no budget' short film, working with other volunteers, if we can pre-sell enough DVDs / downloads to cover Ann-Marie and Rose's expenses to come up from Dorset for a fortnight of pre-production and a week of production (five days, and travelling two days). Any monies left over from making Wandering Willies' Tale will go towards the costs of developing our first feature, Scott's Rob Roy, in 2025.

The first feature film in the Scottish Dramas Project (SDP) are adapting and producing is Rob Roy (2025). The Project is then moving on to the rest of Scott's Scottish novels such as, Guy Mannering (2026), followed by Waverly (2027). etc. Our tenth feature film will be the tragic musical, The Bride of Lammermoor. For the first feature, Rob Roy, we hope to gain the assistance of the Sir Walter Scott and the Clan Societies' memberships, etc., to help on pre-selling DVDs, or a streaming version, as well as the help of other charities / businesses in gaining 'in-kind' sponsorships. We can thus make these features as 'no/low budget' features, with 'street casting'.
