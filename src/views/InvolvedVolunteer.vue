          We roundly welcome all volunteers. There are certainly many ways in which you can have fun helping us to
          produce
          Walter Scott dramas.

          This volunteering will have the added advantage of giving you experience in your chosen field and industry,
          and
          gaining you a reference from ourselves with regard to your kind help with our film and podcast making.

        <p>Here are some of the immediate ways in which you can help. Doubtless, as we grow, many more roles will develop:</p>
        <p class="lead">Writing</p>
        <p>You could help by writing some of Scott's short story screen adaptations (help will be given). When we have
          acquired (the copyright remains yours) four, or more 'possible' scripts, these could be aggregated them
          together to make a dramatic podcast season (see our other project:
          <a href="https://thedailydilettante.com/podcasts" target="_blank">The Thomas Hardy project</a>) which
          would then be enacted and podcasted.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">Actors, Crew and Helpers</p>
        <p>
          You could be in our cast, crew, or production teams. All levels, from beginner up, are most welcome.
