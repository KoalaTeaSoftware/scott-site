        <h2>Scott's Rob Roy</h2>
        <p>
          The first feature film the Scottland Dramas Project is adapting and producing is <strong>Rob Roy</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>The Project is then moving on to the rest of Scott's 'Scottish novels', such as,
          <strong>Guy Mannering</strong>, followed by <strong>Waverly</strong>. etc. Our tenth feature
          film, in this Scott film cycle, will be our tragic musical,
          <strong>The Bride of Lammermoor</strong>. This will be our our only musical film, however.
        </p>
        <p>For the first feature, <strong>Rob Roy</strong>, we hope to gain the assistance of the Sir Walter Scott
          Society, and the various Clan Societies' memberships, etc., to help with pre-selling DVDs (or a streaming
          version), as well as the help of other charities / businesses in gaining 'in-kind' sponsorships. We can thus
          make these features as 'no/low budget' features, with 'street casting' from the Edinburgh / S.E. Borders'
          area.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">We do look forward to working with all of you 'Scottland' supporters!</p>
