          The first feature film the Scottish Dramas Project is adapting and producing is Rob Roy (2025).
        </p>
        <p>The
          Project is then moving on to the rest of Scott's Scottish novels such as, Guy Mannering (2026), followed by
          Waverly (2027). etc. Our tenth feature film will be the tragic musical, The Bride of Lammermoor.
        </p>
        <p>For the first
          feature, Rob Roy, we hope to gain the assistance of the Sir Walter Scott and the Clan Societies' memberships,
          etc., to help with pre-selling DVDs, or a streaming version, as well as the help of other charities / businesses
          in gaining 'in-kind' sponsorships. We can thus make these features as 'no/low budget' features, with 'street
          casting'.
