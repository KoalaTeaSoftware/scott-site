  <h2>Traditional Scottish / Celtic Folk Bands</h2>
  <p>A big invitation to all scottish / celtic folk bands!!</p>
  <p>Our project welcomes your playing and / or singing on our </p>
  <p>Scottland Bards' Internet Radio</p>
  <p>We are an unfunded community group, but, although we can't therefore pay you licenses and royalties, we can give you free
  exposure to those who want to hear your music.</p>
  <p>We seek pre-1900 AD i.e. traditional Scottish / Celtic folk music recordings. We seek, basically, Celtic instrumentation
    (e.g. guitars OK, but no banjos) although a little modern electrical help is OK; also Celtic harmonies / modes (so no serial music!)
    vocal music is welcomed ine either English, or Celtic (Scottish / Irish / Britannic, etc.)..</p>
  <p>We will collect your uploaded recordings this year (early '23) and start the radio later in the year. Get your friends to vote
  for you every time you hear your piece played and your work may be selected for our podcast.</p>
