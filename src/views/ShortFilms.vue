        <p>We will be making this 'concept short film' as a 'no budget' short film, working with other volunteers, if we
          can pre-sell enough DVDs / downloads to cover Ann-Marie and Rose's expenses to come up from Dorset for a
          fortnight of pre-production and a week of production (five days, and travelling two days). Any monies left
          over from making Wandering Willies' Tale will go towards the costs of developing our first feature, Scott's
          Rob Roy, in 2025.
